## 1. Introduction

It's my first C project in MIPT. So don't judge harshly and treat with understanding.
This program solves equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.

<a name="begin"></a>
## 2. Beginning

User enters coefficients a, b, c.
And then gets answer.
The program gives out amount of roots and the roots of equation. 

Example:

```
Saluton mia amiko. This program will help you to solve qudratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0
Let`s start

/*[in]*/  a = 5
/*[in]*/  b = 2
/*[in]*/  c = -2

/*[out]*/ There are two roots : x1 = 0.463325, x2 = -0.863325

```

## 3. Conclusion

As a result, optimization of the hashtable gave an increase of 4.38 times

That sounds good
